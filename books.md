  “So many books, so little time.”  ― Frank Zappa

Few years ago, I was so depressed I found a new meaning in traveling solo but the new meaning I found lasted only couple of months. I would then travel solo again hoping this time I would find the meaning of life but that never happened. What I was missing all these years was a good self help book and now my salvation is "KNOWLEDGE". Here are some books that have changed my life. They are in no particular order.
