title: My Ways of Traveling Cheap
---

I have yet to meet a person who does not like to travel. Every person I have ever striked up a conversation with, regarding traveling, have shown their sheer interest in traveling. When I am having those conversations, one thing is sure to come up and that is the budget aka money.

I have heard quotes like "Money does not buy happiness". I suppose that this quote was either quoted by a poor person who does not want to work hard and be rich or by a rich perosn who does not want others to be rich. For a broke traveller like me, money decides whether I will travel or not and if I have the money I can travel and I can be happy.

Nepal offers a lot of appealing places to travel to and some of them can be exponentially expensive and those are the best places to travel to. As a Nepali earning in Nepalese currency, it is ridiculously expensive to travel to these places. I believe a lot of you guys make money somewhere between 5K to 20K. Suppose you earn 10k/mnth and it costs around 10k for 6 days ABC trek.It took you a month to earn 10k and just 6 days to spend your whole month`s salary. Just a gentle reminder, I have not even mentioned the surving part when you are not traveling and surviving in Kathmandu is not cheap too.

Here I will write 8 tips that you may find helpful. These tips that I am about to give you is based on my experiences. If you really find it helpfull, please let me know. That would mean a lot to me.

* Before traveling anywhere, I do a lot of research on that particular place. When I made plans to travel to Kalinchowk I researched for 3 whole months and got a huge deal of facts and figures.I got informations on bus ticket price to Kalinchowk and how to get discounts on them? Not only that, I realised a lot of pictures that I saw on them blogs on the trail that assured me that I was traveling on the right trail.

* You have to learn to set aside budgets for each day. Whenever I travel, I set aside a budget of 1K for each day. Sure, you may spend less than that but it is better to not have any financial issue while you are traveling.

* Make friends with hotel owners, guides and everyone you meet. On my solo trek to ABC, I made good friends with 4 trekking guides and a hotel owner. I did not make them my friends for my personal gain but I was very lucky that they were generous. The hotel owner at Deurali, en-route to ABC gave me a lot of discounts. For guides, everything is half priced for them in the hotel. They got me warm water, charged my DSLR for half the cost.

* On my trek, I survive on snickers, oat meals and tuna the whole day and eat daal-bhat for my dinner. It significanlty reduced my expense becase at higher altitude daal-bhat costs Rs 500.

* I prefer to live in a dorm room  whenever I travel alone. Living in a dorm room means you have to pay only for the bed and not the whole room. The advantage of it is you get to socialize with a lot of people and the disadvantage is your stuffs may get stolen.

* I have found that, traveling alone is very expensive since I had to pay the full price for the room.

* Staying away from areas catered for tourists. What I meant from that is, everything is expensive in these places. You can book a room anywhere or eat anywhere except these places.

* I prefer to eat at bhaatis or non fancy restro because they are more budget friendly plus the food there also tastes amazing. After I returned from my ABC trek, I stayed in Pokhara for a night. I went to a bhatti and ordered some pork sekuwa at Rs 60, it tasted like heaven. Then I went to a fancy retro catered for tourist and ordered a pork chop for dinner. It tasted like shit and cost me Rs 700.

These are some tips I can provide to you guys from a year of my traveling experience. The reason I am writing a blog on traveling cheap is because I want you guys to travel and find your muse or maybe chill and relax. Whatever it is, I just want to help you guys travel.

Thanks for reading it. You are awesome.
