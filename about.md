Hellow, I am *Sushant Bajracharya* aka *Voyager*. On *Oct 2014*, I traveled for the first time in my life and since then I am hooked to traveling. I took my first MT Everest flight on *Jan 2015* and saw *Mt Everest*. I then decided to climb it some day. Right now it is *Oct 2016* and 20 years from now I will summit it.

Traveling changed my life in a good way. My life now has a purpose, a purpose to scale the tallest mountain. You see, climbing Everest is very expensive. It left me with just a choice ie I have to hustle to earn enough to supoort my dream to scale it. It aroused in me an eager want to be an entrepreneur. As of *Oct 2016*, I am currenlty being mentored by *Bhadra Ale*. I am really excited about this.

Before my first travel, I was not very adventerous but my first travel changed everything. I solo treked to *Kalinchowk* on *Sep 2015*, I was 19 then. On *Apr 2016* I solo trekked to *Annapurna Base Camp* and I am 20 now. During my travel I met a lot of people that really made a good impression in my life. I will never forget them. Wherever they are, I hope for their well being and good life.

When I was in Junior High, I was asked to write about the difficulties in tourism in Nepal and how we can overcome it? I wrote bunch of nonsense back then but looking back at it now, I feel like I should have started traveling very early. I have some great answers for that question now.

I grew up watching and hearing a lot of good things about first world countries. I loved the fact that they are independent from a young age. It really inspired me to be independent so at 18 I was financially semi independent and at 20 I am fully financially independent.

Besides all my love to travel and entrepreneurship, I love to code as well. I started coding at 18 and as of 2016 I am a Software Engineer(Team Lead) at *Bajra Technologies*

If you ask me what is the craziest thing I have done in life then it would be

* I left a very high paying job because it was not pushing me out of my comfort zone.
* I solo treked to Kalinchow on off season. I was the only tourist there.

Life is full of suprises and I hope it keeps throwing these at me. It would be a good excuse to update my *About* page.

Thanks for reading! Have a great day
