title: What I am up to?

Hey yo,

* My push up routine have finally changed. I do normal push ups until failure then take 30 sec break and do diamond push up until muscle failure and take break for another 30 sec and finally do wide grip push ups until my muscles give up. I do 2 sets of these everyday now.
