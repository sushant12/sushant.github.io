Have you guys ever wondered how it would feel like to hike a trail that circles the KTM valley? Yes, I do too. When I hike, I always wonder where the rest of the trail will go and how far will it go? How it would feel to spend a night in the woods in the realm of nature? It amazeses me when couple of hills later I land to a different district. Just like roads in the city, the hills are connected with a trail which is seldom traveled and only known to the villagers.

# Why are we doing this?

I want to bring the trail that will connect the hills surrounding KTM valley in the map for hikers who wants to spend several days hiking and camping.

# How will we do this?

I will form a team of 3 hikers. We will try to connect with organizations who can provide us some necessary gears like GPS device, compass, tents,etc and in return give them the data. I will only make the deal if the data is to be published openly for all the general public. Everyday, I will post a picture or two of the progress and before sleeping I will write a small journal. After the hike is completed, I will write a blog on the trail and my experiences.

# What is the benefit of doing this?

There is no right or wrong answer to this, but when taking on a challenge with a high degree of difficulty, it has something to do with purpose. This VCH trail can be a test of personal will and strength to someone or to experience an unadulterated sense of freedom to someone else. To someone who is disgusted with `civilizatoin` this trail could be a good rolling of the feet to ease the mind.

At the end, all I hope for is developing a camping and hiking culture in Kathmandu. While the hiking culture is strong the camping culture still needs a lot of contribution to catch the momentum with the hiking culture.

Below is the list of routes and gears.
