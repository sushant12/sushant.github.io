	The dream to circuit hike the whole Kathmandy valley came in the early 2017. While plans were made to conduct the circuit hike on Nov 2017, my naivety caused some delay in execution. After meeting tons of people related with and not related with travel, I have now learned to make estimations. The departure date is not fixed yet but I have mapped the routes in the google maps, pepared a list of gears we will need and working on the budget estimation for the trip.
